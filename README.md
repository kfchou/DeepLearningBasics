# DeepLearningBasics
This repo contains reference scripts for various types of networks.
 
The networks here will be implemented mostly in Keras. The notebooks will contain technical notes intended to teach newcomers how to build simple networks in Keras. I assume readers already have a good understanding of deep learning concepts, such as that taught by deeplearning.ai.
