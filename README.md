# DeepLearningBasics
This repo contains scripts for various types of networks, implemented using Keras, as well as notes taken on my journey into the world of deep learning.
 
The notebooks contain technical notes intended to teach newcomers how to build simple networks in Keras. I assume readers already have a good understanding of basic deep learning concepts, such as that taught by deeplearning.ai.

I recommend readers to go through the notebooks in this order:
1. Multilayer preceptrons - basic deep neural nets
2. ConvNet - basic convolutional neural nets
3. ResNets - Residual networks
4. Autoencoders
5. VAEs - Variational Autoencoders
6. DC-GAN - Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial network
